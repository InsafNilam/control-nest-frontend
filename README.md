# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## UI Design:

Aceternity UI and Shadcn UI: Ensure consistency in design elements and user experience across both interfaces. Use the strengths of each UI library to create a visually appealing and intuitive interface.
Tailwind CSS: Utilize Tailwind CSS to fine-tune styles and ensure responsiveness across different screen sizes.
Backend:

Prisma DB Integration: Prisma simplifies database access and management. Ensure your models are well-defined and optimize database queries for performance.
Server Actions and API Integrations: Implement CRUD operations securely on the server-side, validating inputs and handling errors gracefully. Use RESTful APIs for efficient data transfer between the frontend and backend.

Authentication: Implement a secure authentication system using JWT tokens or session-based authentication. Ensure proper validation and sanitization of user inputs to prevent security vulnerabilities like XSS or CSRF attacks.

## Features:

Intuitive Interface: Experience a beautiful and user-friendly interface crafted with the latest Aceternity UI and Shadcn UI libraries. Tailwind CSS ensures a responsive and visually appealing design across all devices.

Seamless Note Management: Effortlessly create, edit, delete, and search your notes (CRUD operations) with a powerful note management system.

Reliable Data Storage: Never worry about losing your notes again! ControlNest utilizes a live connection to a database (likely a relational database) through Prisma integration, guaranteeing data persistence even after you close the application.

Robust Server-Side Actions and API Integrations: Benefit from powerful server-side actions and API integrations that streamline data handling and functionality. (Note: Specific details about these integrations would be included in a more technical document.)

Secure Login System: Sign up for a free account and enjoy a secure login process to manage your devices  privately.
